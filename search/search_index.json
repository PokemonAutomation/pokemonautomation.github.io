It is one of the few microcontrollers that supports Bluetooth Classic (BTC) since the world has moved onto Bluetooth LE (BLE). Thus it is (almost) uniquely suited to implement the Switch 1 wireless controllers which are also BTC.The USB port on it is a built-in UART intended for debugging, but we hijack it as the main line of communication with CC to eliminate the need for an external UART. This makes it super convenient since a simgle USB adapter turns it into fully wireless dongle that allows your computer full control of your Switch without the hassle of any cables at all.The ESP32 also supports BLE which is what the Switch 2 wireless controllers use. So it has the potential to implement the Switch 2 wireless controllers in the future. ESP32-S3Supported Controllers:- HID: Keyboard- Switch 1: Wired controller- Switch 2: Wired controllerThe ESP32-S3 is the by far the best wired controller setup. It has both USB OTG and USB UART as separate ports. The USB OTG can be programmed as a game controller while the USB UART elminates the need for the external UART that was needed by the AVR8 setups (Arduino/Teensy). Thus ESP32-S3 is the perfect replacement for those older setups. Ease of setup is very important as it lowers the technical bar of entry for new users.The ESP32-S3 also supports Bluetooth, but only Bluetooth LE (BLE). So while it cannot implement the Switch 1 wireless controllers, it does give us future ambitions of supporting the Switch 2 wireless controllers. Pico WPico 2 W Raspberry Pi: Pico W and Pico 2 WSupported Controllers:- HID: Keyboard- Switch 1: Wired Controller- Switch 2: Wired Controller- Switch 1: Wireless Pro Controller- Switch 1: Left Joycon- Switch 1: Right JoyconThe Raspberry Pi Pico W is unique in that it can support every single controller. However, accessing the wired controllers is more difficult as it requires more setup.The large (silver) chip is a Bluetooth module that supports both BTC and BLE. This allows it to implement wireless controllers. Meanwhile, the USB port on it is USB OTG which allows it to implement the wired controllers. But unlike the ESP32-S3, it does not have a 2nd USB port to use as a UART connection to the computer. Therefore we have programmed two operating modes for the Pico W:- USB Mode- UART ModeIn USB mode, the USB port acts as a serial port that can be plugged directly into the computer. This makes it functionally the same as the ESP32 with only wireless controller support.In UART mode, the USB port becomes a wired controller plugged into the console. This unlocks all the remaining (wired) controllers. However, you need to wire up an external UART to UART1 in order for it to communicate with the computer. Thus this setup is similar to that of the Teensy 2 and Pro Micro with the added bonus of the wireless controller support.Both operating modes use the same firmware binary. On boot, it starts in USB mode. It will automatically switch to UART mode the moment it sees valid traffic on UART1. Arduino Uno R3Supported Controllers:- Switch 2: Wired controllerThe Arduino Uno R3 is one of the original boards that spearheaded the Nintendo Switch automation community. However, it's ATmega16U2 AVR8 CPU is very weak with only 512 bytes of ram and 12KB of usable program memory.This controller is only suitable for emulating the basic wired controllers. It doesn't even have enough memory to hold multiple controller implementations the way that some of the newer controllers can. Arduino LeonardoSupported Controllers:- Switch 2: Wired controllerThe Arduino Leonardo uses an ATmega32U4 AVR8 CPU. It has significantly more ram and program memory at 2.5KB and 32KB respectively. This was the last addition to the AVR8 microcontroller line up and was chosen because it was easier to setup a serial connection than the Teensy or Pro Micro boards.Being an AVR8 processor, it shares codebase with the Arduino Uno R3 and thus we only support a single wired controller type on it. Pro MicroSupported Controllers:- Switch 2: Wired controllerThe Pro Micro uses an ATmega32U4 AVR8 CPU and is functionally the same as the Arduino Leonardo and Teensy 2.0. This was added to our lineup because it was the cheapest microcontroller of this type in volume. Thus it became the work horse for many people with multiple Switches. Teensy 2.0Supported Controllers:- Switch 2: Wired controllerThe Arduino Uno R3 is one of the original boards that spearheaded the Nintendo Switch automation community.The Teensy 2.0 uses an ATmega32U4 AVR8 CPU and is functionally the same as the Arduino Leonardo and Pro Micro. This (along with the Teensy++ 2.0) was by far the best board during the microcontroller-only automation era due to the easy-to-use button to put the board into flash mode. It began to fall out of use in the computer-control era due to the difficulty of setting up a serial connection on it. Teensy++ 2.0Supported Controllers:- Switch 2: Wired controllerThe Teensy++ 2.0 is the same as the Teensy 2.0, but with an upgraded AT90USB1286 CPU which has much more ram and program memory.This extra ram and program memory was never put to use in this project. So it is functionally the same as the Teensy 2.0 along with all its advantages and drawbacks."},{"location":"ControllerList.html#controller-types","title":"Controller Types","text":"<p>A \"controller\" (not to be confused with the microcontrollers above) refers to a game controller that will be emulated for the purpose of controlling the game console.</p> Image Description HID: KeyboardThis is a standard HID keyboard over USB.

Thus it provides the fastest method for Fast Code Entry.This uses the standard 8-byte HID keyboard report that allows for up to 6 keys to be held at once. Switch 1: Wired ControllerThis is the standard 3rd party \"officially licensed\" wired controller. Most wired controllers from Horipad and PowerA fall into this category.This controller type only supports the standard buttons/joystick and do not support rumble or gyro. It also does not support custom colors in its icon when connected to the Switch.These use the standard 8-byte HID report type with 14 buttons, a dpad, and two joysticks with 8-bit precision. Switch 2: Wired ControllerThis is the same as the Switch 1 wired controller, except that they add the GL, GR, and C (gamechat) buttons for the Switch 2. This controller type is backwards compatible with the Switch 1 such that pressing the new buttons simply do nothing on the Switch 1.These also use the standard 8-byte HID report type with 17 buttons, a dpad, and two joysticks with 8-bit precision. Due to the button field having only 16 bits, the 17'th button (the C button) instead uses an unused bit in the dpad byte. Switch 1: Wireless Pro ControllerThis is the official pro controller from Nintendo - connected wirelessly to the Switch.At this time, this project does not support gyro, rumble, NFC, or console wake up.

You can read the comments of those functions to understand how to use them.</p> <p>Note we use ticks to measure the amount of time a button action is executed.

It may just send the command to the micro-controller and continue executing following lines of code. Our software that runs on the micro-controller uses a buffer to hold incoming button commands. The <code>pbf</code> function has to wait only when the buffer on the micro-controller is full. It will wait until the micro-controller finishes executing the oldest command in the buffer so that the buffer has space to receive the new command.*</p> <p>For example, if the micro-controller buffer is empty and a program sends a command of holding button A for 200 ticks and releasing it for 100 ticks, the program will not wait for 300 ticks during exeuction of <code>pbf_press_button()</code>. The function quickly returns and the program begins executing the next line of code. At the same time, the micro-controller will start spending 300 ticks to execute the button command. It will keep pressing button A to the Switch for 200 ticks, then release it and wait for 100 ticks.</p> <p>This is like the case of asynchronous IO processing in some software systems.</p> <p>Important: You should not rely this asynchronous behavior to perform parallelization. The internal buffer sizes are undocumented and may change at any time. And some functions may break into a sequence of instructions that occupy multiple buffer slots. The purpose of the asynchronous buffering is to preserve the exact timing of button sequences across an otherwise high-latency serial bus.</p>"},{"location":"Developer/Button.html#wait-for-commands-to-finish","title":"Wait for Commands to Finish","text":"<p>So in the case like you would want the program to wait for the button commands to finish before doing some other tasks (e.g. reading the video stream), you need to call <code>context.wait_for_all_requests()</code> after the code of button commands. This function stops the program from doing anything until all the commands sent to the micro-controller have finished. An example usage is in PokemonLA_PokedexTasksReader. The program reads Pok\u00e9dex tasks. After it sends button commands that tells the game to go to the next Pok\u00e9dex page, it calls <code>context.wait_for_all_requests()</code> before reading the video stream.

For example, if the path of SerialPrograms is <code>C:\\git\\Arduino-Source\\build\\SerialPrograms.exe</code> then the resource folder should be <code>C:\\git\\Arduino-Source\\Resources</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Make a new Git branch on your local machine. You can name the branch by the name of the new feature you would like to implement. Do not add any new code directly to the main branch. All new code should be added to your feature branch. </li> <li>Before adding commits to the branch, set correct author name and email info in the Git config file. If you want to maintain anonymous, make sure you don't expose your personal info in your Github account and commit messages. Double check you don't set a global author and email info across that could add your personal info on a new Git repo.</li> <li> <p>Write the feature code. Add commits of the new code change to the feature branch.</p> <ul> <li>If you add or remove code files in the source-code folder, you need to update the file list in CMakeLists.txt. See Add New Files for more details.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Test the code of this branch to make sure it works and it won't cause problems when merged to the Git trunk (aka main branch) of the codebase.</p> </li> <li>Clean the code:<ul> <li>Remove commented code that no longer used.</li> <li>Remove unecessary debugging code.</li> <li>Organize and simplify code, like converting duplicate code blocks into reusable functions.</li> <li>Add enough comments so that it is easy for you and others to maintain the code in future, and our repo maintainers can understand your code.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Push (aka upload) this branch from your local machine to your online Github repo.</li> <li>On Github, send a pull request (PR for short) to notify our repo maintainers that a feature development is ready for review.</li> <li>The repo maintainers review the new code in the PR, comment on it and give some suggestions if needed.</li> <li>Discuss and take those suggestions if needed by improving the code on your local machine. Then push them to update the PR. This may take several rounds of back and forth.</li> <li>The repo maintainers approve the PR about the feature branch, adding the code into the original repo.</li> <li>Prepare for developing next feature:<ul> <li>After the new code has been added to the original repo as new commits, update the main branch of your online Github repo so that you receive the new commits as well. </li> <li>One way to do this is to create a remote branch <code>upstream</code> that points to the official repo.

A PR is like a post you sent to the maintainers, which lists all your code changes and optionally your comments about them. Both you and the maintainers can comment under the PR, like you commenting under an internet post. To create a PR, you need to associate a branch to it. Therefore you need to create a new branch on your local machine, push (aka upload) it and link it to a PR. You automatically link a PR to the branch when you click a \"Create a PR\" button on your Github repo for a particular branch you pushed to Github.</p> <p>Why not use the default branch that is created when initializing my local repo on my local machine? Because the default branch is often the main branch, which serves as the \"base\": where the code is without your new change. You don't want to add change to this main branch, destroying the content of what the code is before your change. This is also a good habit of making a separate branch for your changes. If you would like to work on two features at the same time, with two branches you can separate the changes cleanly, reducing your mental load. And you never know when something may happen during developing that forces you to write a new feature. Having all your changes in separate branches keep you clean so that you can easily add a new feature on a new branch that is forked from the main branch, without worrying about prior local changes.</p>"},{"location":"Developer/ImageMatching.html","title":"Template Image Matching","text":"<p>Image matching is usually done with the Watcher classes, which is usually used by the <code>run_until</code> and <code>wait_until</code> functions.

This can also be useful when the thing you're waterfilling for has poor contrast difference from the background, (for example, the flag pin in PLA against the icelands snow during midday).</p> <p>One method to finding the correct color filters is to take a screenshot, crop to the object that you want to detect, then use the color picker in an image editor (e.g. MS Paint or Paint.net). Then find the range of RGB values for your object. Alternatively, you can use trial and error, while inspecting the dump folder to expand or narrow the filters as needed. The dump folder will be discussed further in a later section.</p> <p>Note that the Waterfill matcher works best on images with solid colors. The Waterfill matcher cannot handle occlusion (i.e. other object covering/partially covering your desired object). For example, if the image you're trying to match is blue, but it's partially covered by something that is yellow, the Waterfill object will only include the blue portions, and not the portions covered by the yellow.</p> <p>Also, note that if you know exactly where on the screen the desired object should be, you may not even need to use Waterfill, because you can just directly compare your image template with the object at that specific location. Waterfill is mainly useful when you don't know exactly where the desired object is, but it has a distinct and solid color that is different than its surroundings.</p>"},{"location":"Developer/ImageMatching.html#template-matching","title":"Template matching","text":"<p>Each Waterfilled object is compared to the template image, where it must meet the requirements for aspect ratio, area ratio, and RMSD.</p> <p>The aspect ratio is equal to width/height.

Think of a Pok\u00e9mon slug as a nickname we give to this type of Pok\u00e9mon to be used in the code. Why not use the Pok\u00e9mon's real name? Because it is a good software development practice to separate what is shown on the UI and what is used in the code. For example, a displayed name may need to have several versions according to the language setting (Japanese, English and so on), but in the code when sorting those Pok\u00e9mon, we want a consistent name to refer to them.</p> <p>We follow the style of using lowercase letters and \"-\" to form slugs. For example, The slug of the Mime Pok\u00e9mon Jr. is \"mime-jr\". Most of the Pok\u00e9mon JSON files (See the JSON topic page for more details on JSON files) use slugs. For example, Pokedex-National.json which stores the slug for each Pok\u00e9mon species in national Pok\u00e9dex order. We also have a JSON for listing Pok\u00e9mon names under all languages PokemonNameDisplay.json. Those names are useful for OCR (see the OCR topic page for more details). There are also slugs for each type of Pok\u00e9ball, each type of berry and so on.</p> <p>Note as Game Freak and The Pok\u00e9mon Company recycle more and more Pok\u00e9mon designs by creating different forms (e.g. regional forms) of the same Pok\u00e9mon species, each form can have its own unique slug. The slugs in Pokedex-National.json are all form-less slugs, while those in MMOFirstWaveSpriteList.json are form-aware slugs. We follow the style of the first form slug of a Pok\u00e9mon is just the slug of the Pok\u00e9mon species name, while the second form is the slug of the Pok\u00e9mon species name plus \"-\" and some description of the form. For example, in MMOFirstWaveSpriteList.json we have a slug \"shellos\" for Shellos West Sea form and slug \"shellos-east-sea\" for Shellos East Sea form.</p> <p>To load the national Pok\u00e9dex, use <code>NATIONAL_DEX_SLUGS()</code>.

Starting the program in front of the NPC, you need to press A, then wait several ticks for the dialogue box to appear, and press D-pad down to move the cursor to the desired item in the menu. How many waiting ticks is enough to connect the two button presses? You can test different ticks until the automation program runs stably on your Switch. To make sure that other users who have a slower Switch than you can also run the program, it would be better to relax the wait time by a few more ticks.</p> <p>But a longer wait time may make the program slower. And you don't know if the wait time is long enough for all the users. To take more care of the robustness and performance, there are several other approaches:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Make this wait time tunable by users. Expose this wait time as a program option. This has the benefit of those with a slower Switch can set a long wait time to have robust runs while those with a faster Switch can set a short wait time to get better performance. But this adds more things for the users to do and the users may also be annoyed by tuning the wait time themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use visual feedback (or called visual inference): use <code>wait_until()</code> (see the parallel routine topic page for more details) and other functions to let the program wait until a visual indication is detected, signaling the dialogue menu is fully displayed. Then press the next button. This has the benefit of the program adapting to the dialogue display speed. The drawback is that it is more coding work to write visual detection code, and the program is generally slower than a fine-tuned feedback-less button sequence. It is because the program has to wait for the video frames to be parsed through the capture card and needs the visual detection code to finish running.</p> </li> <li> <p>Send the button press first without visual feedback, but also monitor the video stream and detect if there is deviation (overshoot or undershoot) of the menu cursor from what the program expects it to be based on the button presses. If a deviation is found, using a correction procedure to fix it. This is the most complicated to implement among all the approaches, but it is robust to different Switch speed and generally fast to run.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can mix and match all the approaches. Use the approach that is suitable for the task. For simple and short automation tasks like mass releasing Pok\u00e9mon in the storage, you can hardcode the wait times between button presses. For performance sensitive tasks like selecting Pok\u00e9balls in Dynamax Adventure, to pursue best shiny hunting performance, use the overshoot-correction mechanism.</p>"},{"location":"DiscordIntegration/index.html","title":"Discord Integration:","text":"<p>The computer control (CC) application can integrate with Discord.

Both can send notifications, but do so differently.</p> <p>A webhook is a URL. You (or anyone else that knows the URL) can make a POST request to that URL and then Discord will send the contents of that request as a message in the webhook's channel. This is all that webhooks can do. They can do nothing else except send a message in one specific channel. Webhooks are not restricted by permissions; making a valid request to the hook will always result in a message, there's no way to prevent that.</p> <p>Bots are actual users in Discord, more or less the same as human users. They join your server and then show up in the server's member list. Bots have access to Discord's entire API and can do basically the same things a human can do. Meaning they can send/read/delete/pin messages, create/delete/assign roles, create/delete/edit channels, kick/ban members, all that jazz. They are subject to the same permission system as normal users, so you can use permissions to regulate what a specific bot is allowed to do.</p> <p>Messages sent by webhooks have more formatting options. You can use named links embeds inside the regular message content instead of just inside embeds, and you can send multiple embeds in one message. With webhooks you can also choose a different username and avatar for each message, while bots, just like humans, have one username and avatar that consistently shows up with every message.</p> <p>If you want to live-host on a server, most servers (including us and SHA) require a bot instead of a webhook even though all it does is post notifications.

The canonical method to issuing a fixed schedule of button presses with precise timings is to rely on the USB controller poll rate of 125 Hz or 8 milliseconds. Thus for every 125 times that the host (the Switch) requests a controller state, we know that exactly 1 second has elapsed. This 8 millisecond \"tick\" is precisely how the tick-based time unit evolved in both our MC and CC automation.</p> <p>Both the Switch 1 as well as any computer will poll the controller at this steady 125 Hz. However, the Switch 2 has been observed to vary the poll rate between 125 Hz and 62.5 Hz. Needless to say, this broke our Arduino/Teensy controllers which we had to fix.</p> <p>For developers, we now have 3 different controller setups with different minimum time units (tick size):</p> <ul> <li>Wired controller (Switch 1): 8ms</li> <li>Wired controller (Switch 2): 8ms or 16ms</li> <li>ESP32 Wireless: 15ms</li> </ul> <p>The minimum time unit is the minimum amount of time between controller state changes. Meaning that if you press A, you cannot release it until at least 8ms later (for 8ms tick size). ESP32 increased it to 15ms. Now on Switch 2, it needs to be at least 16ms.</p> <p>In the vast majority of cases, this does not matter since buttons need to be held down for at least ~40ms for the Switch to register it as a press.

The moment, you click \"update\" (either intentionally or not), you will be blocked from playing the game until it updates.</p> <p>Airplane Mode:</p> <p>If the Switch knows there is a new update, run all programs in airplane mode if possible.

Then you can recover the old version.</p> <p>Configure Programs to Avoid the Update Window:</p> <p>Most of the programs in this project that navigate between the game and the Switch settings will inevitably encounter any game or system update menus. Unexpected updates will usually break the running program because the program will trigger the update and restart the Switch. This is especially bad for CFW since they need to hold off firmware updates until the custon firmware itself is updated to support it.</p> <p>To counteract this, there are two options in <code>Switch -&gt; Framework Settings</code> that allow the programs to avoid the update menu by inserting an UP+A press.</p> <ul> <li><code>Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)</code></li> <li><code>Tolerate System Update Menu (slow)</code></li> </ul> <p>The \"fast\" one is enabled by default.

When a move has no PP, the program will move to the next move when it finds the move selection menu is not closed in time.</p> <p>The first Pok\u00e9mon sent to battle is always the Pok\u00e9mon you selected in the bottom right corner of the screen in the overworld. When a Pok\u00e9mon is switched out either due to fainting or user input, the program will try to send a Pok\u00e9mon from the party to battle, in the same order as the party list. When a fainted Pok\u00e9mon is selected to send out, the program will find out it cannot be sent and move to the next Pok\u00e9mon in the party.</p> <p>The program will report the number of battles, number of turns, number of lead Pok\u00e9mon's move use attempts before any fainting/switching and number of Pok\u00e9mon switches due to fainting.</p> <p>Warning:</p> <p>If a Pok\u00e9mon is fainted when battle ends, it will not receive exp. If you aim to grind exp, make sure your Pok\u00e9mon are strong enough to defeat the opponent and the Pok\u00e9mon you want to grind exp is alive when battle ends.</p> <p>If you aim to grind move and style usages, make sure your Pok\u00e9mon are fast or bulky enough so that they can at least use one move during battle.</p> <p>Example usages:</p> <ul> <li>Grind move usage and style usage research tasks for your high-level Pok\u00e9mon:</li> </ul> <p>Beat an easy opponent like Wenton, Bren or Ress repeatedly with required move styles. Put the move to grind as the first move and select the proper style. If the move has few PPs, you can grind the research tasks of the second move after the program uses all PPs of the first move. You can also collect small amount of exp for the rest of your party.</p> <p>You can set the program to stop battling after trying a certain number of moves. Enable this by checking the cell Limit Move Attempts and fill in a proper number in the cell Max Move Attempts.</p> <ul> <li>Grind exp on Ingo - but tougher:</li> </ul> <p>Tougher Ingo uses six level 75+ Pok\u00e9mon which provide lots of exp. Use level 95+ Arceus with the legend plate to finish five of his six Pok\u00e9mon most of the time. Use two of your strong Pok\u00e9mon to finish Ingo's remaining ones. The rest three Pok\u00e9mon in your party will receive lots of exp each battle.</p> <ul> <li>Evolve Basculin:</li> </ul> <p>First Level up Basculin to level 60+ with good defensive grit values (or higher level without grit investment). Put the Basculin as the end of your party, but select it in the bottom right corner of the screen in the overworld so that it is sent to battle first. Choose opponent as Wenton and set the program to switch the Basculin after 1 turn. Make sure Basculin is bulky enough that it can reliably endure one attack from Wenton's first Pok\u00e9mon. The program will switch to rest of your Pok\u00e9mon after the first turn. Make sure the rest of your Pok\u00e9mon are strong enough to always defeat Wenton. You should be able to find your Basculin ready to evolve after twenty or so battles.</p> <p>Note: if you find the program reports at least one Faint Switch when running, then there is at least one of your Pok\u00e9mon fainted during battle and the program detects the follow-up switch screen. In this case it might be your Basculin that fainted. Double check Basculin is bulky enough for the battle.</p>"},{"location":"Programs/PokemonLA/IngoBattleGrinder.html#options","title":"Options","text":""},{"location":"Programs/PokemonLA/IngoBattleGrinder.html#opponent","title":"Opponent","text":"<p>The name of the opponent you choose to battle against.

And two consecutive resets will stop the program as it does not know how close it is to the softban.</p> <p>This program will also change your time to prevent the date from rolling over as this will lose the raid.</p> <p>For difficult raids that hard to win with only one host, you can use the Tera Multi-Farmer to host using multiple Switches. Most raids (even 6-star) can be cleared with 2 carefully trained and programmed hosts with the other joiners being idle.</p> <p>Important Warning:</p> <p>As with the Sword/Shield auto-hosts, this Tera auto-host carries a risk of losing the raid. In particular, going online will hard-save the game. If the date (and therefore the raids) has rolled over, you will lose the raid. Likewise you will always lose a raid when going online after an event changes.</p> <p>Even though this program changes the time to try to prevent rollover, it is not guaranteed to always work and may even backfire. You have been warned.</p> <p>General Tera Hosting Notes:</p> <p>Unlike Sword/Shield max raids, SV Tera raids cannot be RNG manipulated. So the only way to find shiny Tera raids is to find natural ones.</p> <p>There are currently three main ways to do it without hacking:</p> <ol> <li>Manual checking, i.e. brute-force. (slow)</li> <li>Use Tera Farmer or Ride Cloner and set them to stop when shiny raid is found. (slowest, but automated)</li> <li>Use CFW scanning. (very fast, but requires a hacked Switch to read memory)</li> </ol> <p>Once you find a shiny raid, you need to save in front of the crystal. Note the current date as you will need to keep the date on this day to retain the raid.</p> <p>To host your shiny raid, make sure your raid is still there. If it isn't, close the game, set the date back to what it was when you first found it, then reload the game.</p> <p>When you host online with a link-code, the code is always randomized.

After completing a raid, your character will rotate to face south. Thus if you aren't already facing south, the crystal spawns may no longer be in front of you. As an extra complication of the Ride Cloner, each time you mount and dismount your ride legendary, you move forward slightly. After about a dozen raids, you will have moved \"through\" the entire crystal such that you are no longer facing the crystal. To counter-act that, the program will periodically move backwards and forward to keep you on the north end of the crystal. But for this to work correctly, you need to be well aligned to the north end of the crystal.</p> <p>If you move your ride legendary to your party and give it an item, it will not retain the item. You first need to mount it (move it out of your party) before it actually \"saves\" the item. So for simplicity, we require that your ride legendary is holding the item and is not in your party. Internally, your ride legendary is stored in a separate memory location from your party members. When it's moved to your party, it is copied out. Thus if you attach the item, the \"main\" copy still does not hold it until you mount your legendary again. After performing the glitch so that your ride legendary is neither mounted nor in your party, mounting it will spawn a new one from the separate memory location. The item needs to be attached in that separate memory location for it to be cloned.</p>"},{"location":"Programs/PokemonSV/RideCloner-101.html#options","title":"Options","text":"<p>Some of these options are the same as the Tera Farmer since this is essentially just a modified version of that Tera Farmer.</p>"},{"location":"Programs/PokemonSV/RideCloner-101.html#mode","title":"Mode:","text":"<ul> <li>Mode 1: Clone only.

This program is very difficult to use and will require understanding of those simpler programs to use properly.)</p> <p>This is the combined egg fetching+hatching program. When used properly, it is nearly as fast as manual hatching.</p> <p>This program is capable of sustaining upwards of 1700 eggs/day (5120 step) even when including time to perform mass release. Thus this is one of the fastest (if not the fastest) automatic egg hatcher that does not require custom firmware.</p> <p>The EggCombined programs require setup so they may be less convenient if you are only trying to hatch one or two shinies of a specific species. But if you are hatching for squares, then this is definitely the program for you.</p> <p>This program requires that you already have a \"reservoir\" of eggs (recommended at least 3 boxes). You can run EggFetcher2 to obtain these eggs.</p> <p>Starting with this reservoir of eggs, this program will hatch those eggs while simultaneously fetching more eggs. Newly fetched can be hatched within the same run of the program. Thus with just 3 boxes of eggs, you can keep hatching until you run out of box space.</p> <p>As with the previous version of this program, hatch and fetch rates will rarely be perfectly synced. Thus the reservoir of eggs will slowly increase or decrease as the program runs. So every once in a while, you will need to adjust the number of eggs with EggFetcher2 or EggHatcher. Advanced users can adjust the fetch rates in this program to keep the reservoir of eggs at the desired size.</p> <p>Be aware that the complexity of this program makes it inherently less reliable than the regular EggHatcher.

Do not just fire up this program and expect it to work. Way too many people are overly eager and skip calibration just to end up wasting many hours from locking on false positives or running from shinies.</p> <p>Section: Unattended Shiny-Hunting Calibration</p> <p>The variable that controls the critical delay for this program is \"Exit Camp to Run Delay\".</p> <ul> <li>When the encounter is not shiny, the LEDs should turn on 0.3 \u2013 1.7 seconds AFTER the battle menu appears. The program will run away from the battle.</li> <li>When the encounter is shiny, the LEDs should turn on at least ~0.3 seconds BEFORE the battle menu appears. The program will not run away and will instead trap itself in the summary of your Pok\u00e9mon.</li> </ul> <p>Make only small changes at a time, no more than +/- 50 ticks at a time.</p> <p>Most Switches will have a working value somewhere between 1800 and 1930 \u2013 which corresponds to more than a second difference between the fastest and slowest Switches. Each tick is 8 milliseconds. (125 ticks per second)</p> <p>Important Note:</p> <p>The SoJ program has significantly higher timing variation than the other SR programs. As a result, it will be harder to calibrate. It may not even be possible in some cases.</p> <p>When you attempt to calibrate, you will find that the variation can be upwards of one second. In other words, you will get an entire range of delays. For the program to work correctly, that entire range of delays needs to fit into the 0.3 \u2013 1.7 second window as suggested above. Therefore you will need to be patient and time multiple encounters to find that range of delays.</p> <p>In reality, the range of delays is probably a Gaussian distribution. So even when you think you've found the range, there will be occasional outliers that fall outside the window and can cause a false positive or a false negative. False negatives you won't know unless you happen to see it. False positives will stop the program. If you get false positives after multiple hours of correct operation, then try increasing your delay by 10 ticks.</p> <p>Too Much Variation:</p> <p>On some Switches and environments, you may find that your range of delays is too large to fit into the recommended timing window. Here are some tricks you can try to reduce that variation:</p> <ul> <li>Restart your Switch.</li> <li>Turn on airplane mode and set \"AIRPLANE_MODE\" to true.</li> <li>Detach your Joy-Cons.</li> </ul> <p>If this still doesn't work, then it may be impossible to completely avoid both false positives and false negatives. Thus you must choose which one is more acceptable. False negatives are usually more acceptable since they don't stop the program. Thus you want to calibrate it such that the shortest menu-&gt;LED time is about 0.3 seconds. Any shiny encounter that comes in exceptionally fast will be lost since the program will run from it.</p> <p>If the variation is so high such that it will run from more than 50% of the shiny encounters, then it becomes more time efficient to use the ShinyHuntUnattended-StrongSpawn program instead.</p>"},{"location":"Programs/PokemonSwSh/ShinyHuntUnattended-SwordsOfJustice.html#setup-of-settings","title":"Setup of Settings","text":"<ol> <li>Text Speed: Fast</li> <li>Casual mode: Off</li> <li>System time: Un-synced</li> <li>Airplane mode: Off</li> <li>You must be offline.</li> <li>The weather in the area does not result in battle weather or terrain (sunlight, rain, snow/sandstorm).

So if you press it 5 times in the row, you will get a notification about sticky keys. You should turn it off.</li> <li>Per-Program Wiki: The top of the window is a link to wiki for the currently selected program. It will contain instructions on how to use the program.</li> <li>Full Screen: Double click a video feed to pop it out into a separate window. Double click the popped-out window again to full screen. ESC will exit full screen.</li> <li>Saving Settings: Settings are automatically saved when you close a program.</li> <li>Console Settings (controller, video, audio) are saved on a per-program basis rather than globally. (This is due to the existence of multi-Switch programs where it makes less sense to save globally.) So every time you switch to different program, you may need to re-enter everything. Needless to say, this can be annoying and inconvenient. Use the \"Save Profile\" and \"Load Profile\" buttons to easily save and load console settings across programs.</li> <li>Upgrading: To upgrade to a new version of the CC programs, download and unzip the new version. Then copy and paste the folder <code>UserSettings/</code> into the same place of the new version. This will transfer over all of your settings and program stats.</li> <li>Suppress Screensaver: If you are using the CC program to play your Switch manually using an external controller, the screensaver will likely kick on or your monitors will turn off due to inactivity on the computer. At the bottom left corner is an option called \"Sleep Suppress\". Check the box to force your computer to keep the monitors on so this doesn't happen. Just remember to turn it off when you are done or your monitors will stay on forever!</li> <li>Stereo Audio: Most cheap capture cards output mono channel audio at 96 KHz. In reality, it is 48 KHz stereo. We split the channels out to give you the original high-quality stereo sound from your Switch!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"SetupGuide/index.html#you-have-now-unleashed-the-power-of-automation-may-you-play-more-than-24-hours-per-day","title":"You have now unleashed the power of automation.

Click on the video display to activate the keyboard controls. Then try pressing some buttons. You can view the keyboard -&gt; controller mapping by clicking on the \"keyboard layout\" at the bottom left corner of the program.</p> <p>The default keyboard layout is the English QWERTY layout. If you have a different layout, you can change the mappings in <code>Nintendo Switch -&gt; Framework Settings</code> and scroll down to the controller mapping tables.</p> <p>We recommend familiarizing yourself with the keyboard controls as this is the preferred way to control your Switch while setting up to run a program. Each controller type has a different keyboard mapping. By default, the joystick (left joystick for Pro Controller) is mapped to the usual WASD setup that's used in FPS games. For joycons, there are two sets of mappings (using different keys) that will serve both vertical and sideways orientations.</p> <p>Overall, the idea here is that you can play your Switch from your computer. While it's not as nice as using a native controller, it is good enough to easily setup programs - especially if you're doing this remotely where you do not have physical access to the Switch.</p> <p></p> <p>Controller Types:</p> <p>You will notice that there are 4 controller options:</p> <ul> <li>None</li> <li>Pro Controller</li> <li>Left Joycon</li> <li>Right Joycon</li> </ul> <p>\"None\" simply idles the ESP32 and turns off its antenna so it isn't trying to connect to a Switch. The others tell the ESP32 to act as that controller respectively. Every time you press \"Reset Ctrl\" or change the controller type, it will disconnect from your Switch and try to reconnect using the new controller type. So you will need to be in the Grip menu or it will stay disconnected. (important if you are accessing remotely!)</p> <p>Changing programs (or even closing the application entirely) will not disconnect the ESP32 from the Switch. When you load a program and connect to the ESP32, it will automatically continue its previous connection to the Switch (and change the controller dropdown accordingly). So you can remotely control your Switch if you are careful enough.</p> <p>If you intend to do a lot of remote access, we recommend that you use a wired setup as a wired controller can connect to the Switch from anywhere and take control.</p> <p>Connecting as a Joycon:</p> <p>When you connect as a joycon, it will behave like a normal joycon. It doesn't immediately connect and wants you to either pair with a 2nd joycon or press SL+SR to put it into horizontal mode.</p> <p>For the right joycon, you can press the Home button to immediately leave the grip menu. This will let you easily start LGPE programs which use the right joycon. The left joycon doesn't have this option and will require you to either pair with a right joycon or to enter horizontal mode. There are currently no programs that use the left joycon.</p> <p>To enter horizontal mode, you can press SL+SR on the keyboard controls by pressing F1 and F3 at the same time. This will let you exit the grip menu and enter a game like LGPE that requires a joycon. But keep in mind that this will also rotate the controls by 90 degrees (IOW, confusing). Check the keyboard mapping for both vertical and horizontal joycon orientations.</p> <p>*You cannot easily pair two ESP32 joycons anyway since you need to press L+R on them simultaneously and the keyboard controls don't allow you simultaneously press buttons on different controllers. However, you can easily pair an ESP32 joycon with a real joycon.</p>"},{"location":"SetupGuide/Controllers/Controller-ESP32-WROOM-MacOS.html#step-7-you-are-done","title":"Step 7: You are done!","text":"<p>If keyboard commands are working (along with video and audio), you are done!</p> <p>Try clicking on other programs on the sidebar.

Click on the video display to activate the keyboard controls. Then try pressing some buttons. You can view the keyboard -&gt; controller mapping by clicking on the \"keyboard layout\" at the bottom left corner of the program.</p> <p>The default keyboard layout is the English QWERTY layout. If you have a different layout, you can change the mappings in <code>Nintendo Switch -&gt; Framework Settings</code> and scroll down to the controller mapping tables.</p> <p>We recommend familiarizing yourself with the keyboard controls as this is the preferred way to control your Switch while setting up to run a program. Each controller type has a different keyboard mapping. By default, the joystick (left joystick for Pro Controller) is mapped to the usual WASD setup that's used in FPS games. For joycons, there are two sets of mappings (using different keys) that will serve both vertical and sideways orientations.</p> <p>Overall, the idea here is that you can play your Switch from your computer. While it's not as nice as using a native controller, it is good enough to easily setup programs - especially if you're doing this remotely where you do not have physical access to the Switch.</p> <p></p> <p>Controller Types:</p> <p>You will notice that there are 4 controller options:</p> <ul> <li>None</li> <li>Pro Controller</li> <li>Left Joycon</li> <li>Right Joycon</li> </ul> <p>\"None\" simply idles the Pico W and turns off its antenna so it isn't trying to connect to a Switch. The others tell the Pico W to act as that controller respectively. Every time you press \"Reset Ctrl\" or change the controller type, it will disconnect from your Switch and try to reconnect using the new controller type. So you will need to be in the Grip menu or it will stay disconnected. (important if you are accessing remotely!)</p> <p>Changing programs (or even closing the application entirely) will not disconnect the Pico W from the Switch. When you load a program and connect to the Pico W, it will automatically continue its previous connection to the Switch (and change the controller dropdown accordingly). So you can remotely control your Switch if you are careful enough.</p> <p>If you intend to do a lot of remote access, we recommend that you use a wired setup as a wired controller can connect to the Switch from anywhere and take control. The Pico W can do this, but only in UART mode.</p> <p>Connecting as a Joycon:</p> <p>When you connect as a joycon, it will behave like a normal joycon. It doesn't immediately connect and wants you to either pair with a 2nd joycon or press SL+SR to put it into horizontal mode.</p> <p>For the right joycon, you can press the Home button to immediately leave the grip menu. This will let you easily start LGPE programs which use the right joycon. The left joycon doesn't have this option and will require you to either pair with a right joycon or to enter horizontal mode. There are currently no programs that use the left joycon.</p> <p>To enter horizontal mode, you can press SL+SR on the keyboard controls by pressing F1 and F3 at the same time. This will let you exit the grip menu and enter a game like LGPE that requires a joycon. But keep in mind that this will also rotate the controls by 90 degrees (IOW, confusing). Check the keyboard mapping for both vertical and horizontal joycon orientations.</p> <p>*You cannot easily pair two Pico W joycons anyway since you need to press L+R on them simultaneously and the keyboard controls don't allow you simultaneously press buttons on different controllers.
